# Metal Gear Solid 2 - PS3 HD Collection Interface & HUD Port
This is a PCSX2 texture pack for Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance (SLUS-20554).
This pack ports most interface and menu-related assets from the Bluepoint remaster of Metal Gear Solid 2 to a format usable and mapped for PCSX2.

----------------

This pack does NOT touch the world, character, or FX textures, for a variety of reasons:

 - Most of these textures scale fine with internal resolution, and do not benefit from the HD Collection assets anywhere near as much as the interface assets.
 - Replacing the interface assets is a few hundred textures. Replacing everything else is upwards of 10000+ textures.
 - Other texture packs, most using AI upscaling, already tackle these textures. While the interface assets have poor output from AI upscaling, the other textures get the job done fine.

----------------

Intending to finish every menu/HUD related asset at some point.

If you notice an error with the texture replacement, please post an issue with a screenshot demonstrating the problem.

All textures converted from PNG using the BC7 DDS Format.

----------------
## Installation

Simply extract the folder from the archive, and drop it in PCSX2/textures.
