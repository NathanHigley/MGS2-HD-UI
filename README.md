# Metal Gear Solid 2 - HD Collection High Quality Font & HUD Port
This is a PCSX2 texture pack for Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance (SLUS-20554).
This pack ports most interface and menu-related assets from the Bluepoint remaster of Metal Gear Solid 2 to a format usable with PCSX2.
### For best appearance, use Internal Resolution 2x (720p)
----------------

This pack does NOT touch the world, character, or FX textures, for a variety of reasons:

 - Most 3D textures scale fine with internal resolution, and do not benefit from the HD Collection assets anywhere near as much as the interface assets.
 - Replacing the interface assets is a few hundred textures. Replacing everything else is upwards of 30000+ textures.
 - Other texture packs, most using AI upscaling, already tackle the 3D textures. While the interface assets have poor output from AI upscaling, the other textures get the job done fine.

----------------

It's difficult to account for *every* texture, as there is a lot of redundancy for some fonts, but extensive effort has been put in to replace as many situations as imaginable.

If you notice an error with the texture replacement, or a texture that you can dump that should be replaced, please post an issue with a screenshot demonstrating the problem, and the dumped texture if possible.

All textures converted from PNG using the BC7 DDS Format.

## Installation

Simply extract the folder from the archive, and drop it in PCSX2/textures.
